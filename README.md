# Auto-Push-Pull-Batch-programs
Two simple, self-explanatory batch programs with their corresponding .txt files for ease of editing. Autopush allows you to make commit notes and does the rest on its own. Adds to the master branch and works best with an SSH certificate(Program for that also on my profile). git remote is assumed to be named 'origin' within each program, change according to specific needs.

place files in the same path as the hidden .git folder
