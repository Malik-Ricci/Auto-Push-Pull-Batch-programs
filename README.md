# Auto-Push-Pull-Batch-programs
# Two simple, self-explanatory batch programs with their corresponding .txt files for ease of editing. Autopush allows you to make commit # notes and does the rest on its own.  Adds to the master branch and works best with an SSH certificate. git remote is assumed to be named # 'origin' within each program, change according to specific needs.
